5. spatial

# Chart Types 

- bar 
    -  for categorical comparisons 
        domain = category 
        range = quantitative 

        note 
        x = left to right
        y = up to down

- histograms 
    - for categorical distributions
        domain: quantitative bins 
        range: represent how often(frequency) of the quant bin

- scatterplots
    - for correlation

    2 atrributes and the relationship betwen their quantitative values


- line chart 
    - for temporal trends 
        domain: temporal 
        range: quantitative 

- trees 
    - for hierachy
        one direction 

        parent child relations
        multiple tiers of category

- node-link 
    - connections
        allow for relationship
        cyclical relationships between entities 

- chloropleth 
    - for spacial trends 
        domain: spatial regions
        range: quantitative 


        - use case
            regional patterns 
            only one variable 
            relative data that is normalized 



# Pie Charts do and dont

- pie chart 
    - for hierarchical part to whole 

    - use when values are round 
        with 3-4 values/parts 

# Intro to svg 

- xml type language 

- svg elements 
    rect:  width height  x and y 
    circle:  cx  cy  r 
    text: x  y  dx dy  text-anchor 
    path: d- path to follow

- svg coordinate system 
    0.0 top left corner 
    x increases going right
